# tool-tracker

Tool tracker is a simple app to help companies keep track of their equipment (it's also a Sinatra project for the Flatiron School's Learn Verified program).

To get started, just sign your company up at '<thiswilleventuallybeawebsite.com>/signup'.  From the dashboard you'll be able to add employees and tools, assign tools to individual employees, and check in tools that have been returned.

Employees that you've added can also create their own account (note: when employees go to create their account, their email address must match the one you submitted when adding them to your company). The employee dashboard allows each of your team members to check out and return tools, as well as see who has a tool checked out.
